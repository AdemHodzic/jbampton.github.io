I have worked both as a client and freelancer for many years and have received many recommendations.
Listed below is some of the feedback I have received.

## As a client

It was a pleasure to work with John again. He is always interesting and informative, and his communications are always clear. What more could one ask? Thanks again John!

John is one of my all-time best clients. His communication is amazing and he's super helpful and informative. That makes my job so much easier! Thanks John.

I hope this is just the first of many projects together with John! He was extremely helpful and cooperative since the beginning until the end of the project. I enjoyed to have worked together and I can't recommend him enough! 10/10!

John is extremely skilled, probably the most skilled client I have worked for. But he has a lot going on and wanted extra hands on a few projects. Very available communicator.

Always a wonderful experience working with John. He stretches, challenges, encourages his freelancers to tackle things even outside their comfort zone, and believes in them to succeed. Looking forward to the next part of the journey, next contract is already in the oven so to speak :)

John is a very skillful guy so he was very easy to work with. He was happy with the work and I wouldn't hesitate to work with him again. He also seemed very friendly and I was paid well for my work. Thanks a lot John for accepting me to do the work!

I had a good experience. Hope you win in Codewars!

John is awesome client. I've learned a lot from John. He is very kind and his skill is very high and professional developer. He is the best developer I've ever seen. I admire his skill and humanity. I'm very impressed with him and I hope to work with him in the future and learn from him so much.

A pleasure to work with. Thank you!

John is great! Kind, smart, an expert in his field and willing to train his freelancers. Highly recommended!

Great client, clear instructions and thanks for the time.

VERY COOL!!!!!

I know quite a bit about John and his level of expertise. He is really on a whole other level in terms of his skill level as a programmer. This was the first time I worked with him as a client, and he turned out to be an excellent client as well. He is very experienced as a contractor, and he knows how to be a great client. I ended up not doing as much work with him as we originally thought we might do just due to scheduling difficulties. Not his fault at all. He was patient and very pleasant to work with.

John is a great person to work with - we ended up not starting this job after all but I've worked with him on previous projects and would definitely recommend him as a client.

Working with John has been an absolute pleasure. He provides clear direction, helpful tips and stellar communication. I feel we have a lot more work to do and I'll enjoy every second with with him. Definitely one of the best clients I've worked with yet. Look forward to our next project. Cheers John!

John is an excellent client and I highly recommend him to everyone.

Working with John was a breeze - he's very professional, easy to talk t–æ, prompt with his specs and payments. Great work experience and definitely a client I can recommend.

John is a great client - easy to talk to, careful to explain the details and the desired results for each task and very promt.

Great client, would like to work for you in future projects.

John Bampton is the best client ever!

I'm so glad that I had the opportunity to work with John! Highly recommend him!

John was a client from Heaven. Excellent communication and responded to all of my questions quickly. I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with him in the future.
